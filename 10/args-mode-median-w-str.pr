fq.py: Program is short and sweet. I did manage to get it to throw a dup mode error with args "1.0 1.0001" which you could have caught with try/except. One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdline arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string. Lastly, your prog throws an error when no cmdline args are entered.
2h.py: Program seems to work as intended. Could perhaps comment a bit more. I like that you check if no cmdline args are entered. I did manage to get it to throw a dup mode error with args "1.0 1.0001" which you could have caught with try/except. I did manage to get it to throw a dup mode error with args "1 2" which you could have caught with try/except. One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdl
ine arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string.
aq.py: Code is well commented. Throws an error hen no cmdline args are entered. Program seems to work well. One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdline arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string.
cw.py: I like that you check that at least one cmdline arg is entered. Program appears to work well. You kindof used try/except as an if/else, which I suppose is fine.  One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdl ine arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string.
dr.py: Program is short, tidy, and well commented. Throws an error if no cmdline args are entered. One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdline arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string.
ww.py: Looks like your program throws an error when no cmdline args are entered. Well commented and appears to work properly. One thing I did differently in my own program was treat a cmdl ine arg such as "1.111" as a float. I can tell you're treating it as a string.
cq.py: This program works! Of all of the programs I reviewed this was the only one that treated a float as entered on the commandline as a float (most people turned "3.1415" into 6, as opposed to the actual float). This was how I read the assignment as well. Nice use of try/except.
