2i.py: I wasn't expecting a nested while loop, but this works! You could have also used nested for loops which some people perfer to avoid infinite loops, but your proram works as intended!
ne.py: This program works as intended. I had a tough time putting the one-liner together, but just a stylistic preference there. Very concise.
t3.py: Looks like you capitalized and printed only the duplicates. I think the goal was to print all of arguments out but only capitalize dups. I could see how the assignment was a little confusing (I actually asked for clarification on the discussion board). I like your code though. I like splitting my code up into functions as well.
ri.py: I think the goal of this assignment was to print out the cmdline arguments in the same order that they were given to the program, but beyond that, I like! I like how you divde your code into sections for functionality.
tk.py: It looks like you print the duplicated items once. I read this assignment a little differently (I printed all of the cmd line arguments...even if they were duplicated...I printed them both out--in the same order entered..and capitalized the dups). Not sure whose interpretation is correct! Code is clean and commented!
8k.py: I see that you printed each argument once even if it was duplicated. I read the assignment a little differently...but you're not the only one to do it this way. :)  Your code is readable concise  and commented. Nice.
yi.py: I see that you printed each argument once even if it was duplicated...I did this a little differently, but I think this assignment could have been read in different ways. Might be a little more readbale if you printed each argument once with the dups capitalized. Code is readbale and commented.
