I suspect your math may have a decimal point in the wrong spot. Several other programs mentioned how much more voting power one senator had vs anohter (idoho senator has approx 11-12 times the voting power of a florida senator).  I don't see that the  program lists any sources on stdout (but I do see you list in your comments).
