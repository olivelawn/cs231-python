x2.py: This program is great and is concise and accurate. I like the formatting of the output. Easy to read. Nice.
wa.py: I like the formatting of this program, but you need to make sure that you display move the decimal 2 places to the right when displaying a percentage.
3z.py: There may have been a misunderstanding of the assignment here. I believe the goal of this assignment was to take the summation of the populations of the uk, us, russia, france, and china and then display that total as a percentage against the total population. 
4h.py: This is correct. Was northern Ireland considered a separate country compared to the UK during WWII?  I actually don't know and am too lazy to goog at the moment. :) Would be nice if you citde your sources! Number look correct tho. Nice.
2v.py: Numbers look correct, but would lovee to see your sources of info here.
n3.py: Program looks correct. Would like to see in your output where your numbers came from.
qa.py: This program looks correct. The output is concise which is fine. If I didn't check your source code I might think you performed the arithmetic outside of the program and just printed the output.
