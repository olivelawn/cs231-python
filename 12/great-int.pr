hn.py: I think something is off here. I see that you're printing out an object. I see that you're regex matches any 1 digit, but I think you want something lik '\d+' which will match 1 or more digits.
jy.py: I needed to copy /users/abrick/resources/urantia.txt to my local directory in order to get your program to work. Your program rereported 999 as the largest integer, but the number 9000 is on line 58872.
9s.py: This program looks like the previous week's homework assignment. I'm not sure if I should comment? Perhaps this has somthing to do with th power outage and leeway given to assignment. The good news is that this program returns 1112604 which is the correct number of words in urantia.txt.
2t.py: Your program returns 5 separate numbers (842,842,682,846,782). I thought the goal was to return the singlee largest number.  I think the largest singl integer is 9000 is on line 58872 of urantia.txt. Based on your regex it looks like you're looking for several sequencs of one or mor digits separated by commas. I think the rgex can be written as '\d+'
iq.py: looks like your program expects urantia to be passed as an argument. Program works and returns 9000 (which I believe is correct) and prgram is well commented.  Nice job.
at.py: It looks like your read this assignment to find the longest string in the text. I think the goal of this assignment was to find the largest integer in the text. I'm thiking what you did might actually be more difficult! Code is well commented.
ip.py: I don't tsee that anywhere in your program that you're opening /users/abrick/resources/urantia.txt.  It looks to me that you're picking out the largest integer that is provided on the cmdline.
