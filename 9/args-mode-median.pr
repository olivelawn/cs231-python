2u.py: This program appears to calculate median and more correctly. Nice. My only concern is that the program fails if no arguments or if words are provided to the program. Program is well commented.
pi.py: This program works as intened. I see that it calulates mode and median correctly. You could improve error checking a bit as the program fails if no arguments or words are passed to the program. Some comments would be nice as well.
g6.py: I don't think this program calculates median correctly. I think if the following arguments are passed: "144 1 7 8 100 100 144 144 200", the median should be 100. I do like that your program account foor passing words in however! It is nicely commented.  
y9.py: This program is excellent. Calculates mode and mean correctly and has nice error checking for numeric arguments (or no arguments).
ei.py: I don't think this program calculates median correctly. I think if the following arguments are passed: "144 1 7 8 100 100 144 144 200", the median should be 100. Program could also have a few more comments.
tv.py: I'm not sure I know what the sortde median is.  I would expect when the following arguments are entered "144 1 7 8 100 100 144 144 200", that the median would be 100. I like that the program handles no cmdline arguments gracefully. Program could use a few more comments
5t.py: I don't think this program calculates median correctly. I think if the following arguments are passed: "144 1 7 8 100 100 144 144 200", the median should be 100. Mode looks good. Program fails wwhen no arguments are entered. Program is well commented!
